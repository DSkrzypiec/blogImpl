# About this blog

Hi! I'm Damian and this is my blog. I wrote mostly about mathematics and
programming in general. Here you can find posts about statistics, R, go, vim and
databases.

## About me
You already know my name and I believe you can deduce my surname. I live in
`Earth->Europe->Poland->Warsaw`. I'm math postgrad but my main interest is
programming and computer science. Currently my main language is 
[go](https://golang.org/) alongside with R and python. I also used to use C# 
and C++. I like classic relational databases, I didn't fell for NoSQL meme. 
I'm vim user and I prefer CLI tools both on Linux and Windows.
