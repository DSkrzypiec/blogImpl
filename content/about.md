# About this blog

Hi! I'm Damian Skrzypiec and this is my blog. I write mostly about mathematics and
programming in general.

## About me

I live in Warsaw, Poland. I'm math graduate but my main interest is programming and computer science. I do like
statically typed and compiled programming languages and data engineering. I have experience in C#, Go and Scala. I like
C++ a lot but unfortunately I didn't work with it professionally. In my old days I was proficient in R and data
science. I'm still proficient in SQLs. I could write thousand-line-long query on a sheet of paper without any syntax
error - sometimes in my free time I'm working on SQL parsers. I'm (Neo)Vim user and I basically live in terminal
whenever I can.

I used to be a speedcuber ([WCA](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2009SKRZ01)). Nowadays I like to play
with 3x3x3 and 5x5x5 during programming to practice my muscle memory and concentration.

For last few years I've been working in financial sector (credit risk to be precise) where I've been an analyst, data
scientist and backend developer. In 2021 I've joined Allegro Pay, which is a subsidiary to the [biggest e-commerce in
Poland](https://allegro.pl), as a senior data engineer. In the second half of 2022, I spent my time working at TCL
Research Europe as a senior big data engineer building overseas big data platform for [TCL](https://www.tcl.com). In
February 2023 I went back to financial world and joined US hedge fund [Point72](https://point72.com) as software
engineer in Risk Technology team.
