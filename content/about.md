# About this blog

Hi! I'm Damian Skrzypiec and this is my blog. I write mostly about mathematics and
programming in general.

## About me
I live in Warsaw, Poland. I'm math graduate but my main interest is programming
and computer science. I do like statically typed and compiled programming
languages and data engineering. I have experience in C#, Go and Scala. I like
C++ a lot but unfortunately I didn't work with it professionally. In my old
days I was proficient in R and data science. I'm still proficient in SQLs. I
could write thousand-line-long query on a sheet of paper without any syntax
error - sometimes in my free time I'm working on SQL parsers. I'm (Neo)Vim user
and I basically live in terminal whenever I can.

I used to be a speedcuber ([WCA](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2009SKRZ01)).
Nowadays I like to play with 3x3x3 and 5x5x5 during programming to practice my
muscle memory and concentration.

For last few years I've been working in financial sector (credit risk to be
precise) where I've been an analyst, data scientist and backend developer.
Last year I've joined Allegro Pay, which is a subsidiary to the
[biggest e-commerce in Poland](https://allegro.pl), as a senior data engineer.
Currently, since August 2022, I'm working in TCL Research Europe as senior big data
engineer building overseas big data platform for [TCL](https://www.tcl.com).
