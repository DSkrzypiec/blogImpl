# About this blog

Hi! I'm Damian Skrzypiec and this is my blog. I wrote mostly about mathematics and
programming in general.

## About me
I live in Warsaw in Poland. I'm math graduate but my main interest is
programming and computer science. Currently my main language is 
[Go](https://golang.org/) alongside with C# and R. I also used to use Python 
and C++. I do like classical relational databases. I'm also interested in functional
programming languages (F# currently). I'm vim user and I prefer CLI tools both 
on Linux and Windows.

I used to be a speedcuber ([WCA](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2009SKRZ01)). 
Nowadays I like to play with 3x3x3 and 5x5x5 during programming to practice my
muscle memory and concentration.

For last few years I've been working in financial sector (credit risk to be
precise) where I've been an analyst, data scientist and backend developer.
