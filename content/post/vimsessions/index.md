# Intro

I wanted to share with you my experience with Vim sessions. The concept and
usage are really simple but I didn't know about it for a long time using Vim.
In a nutshell you can save current state of your Vim environment as a
_session_. Once it's saved it can be reopened.

Have you ever debugging (not necessarily in Vim) for few hours with bunch of
files opened in particular order to wrap your head around the problem? Finally
you built up enough understanding to solve the bug and with relief you close
those dozens of tabs and windows. Few months passes and another bug have
occurred in this area. What now? In best case you _remember_ logic and order of
execution in this particular area from fixing bug few months back and it's not
a problem now. From my experience this is very rare case especially on large
projects and more common case is that you start analyzing this area once again
from the beginning. It might be a bit faster this time but still takes time and
what most important takes a lot of brain power and focus.

My answer to this are Vim sessions.
