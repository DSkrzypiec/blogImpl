## The News

I'm happy to announce that the first [ppacer](https://ppacer.org) release is
out! That is literally version `v0.0.1`. Please check the GitHub release to get
the full list of features and changes: [v0.0.1 on
GitHub](https://github.com/ppacer/core/releases/tag/v0.0.1).


## Is It Ready Then?

Of course it is not. Version `v0.0.1` was focused on making the backend stable
enough and with a minimal set of features to be used by users, including
myself. To be clear, there is no frontend yet. You can use ppacer if you are
comfortable enough with external alerts and querying internal database as a
sort of interfaces to ppacer. So, it is more of a big deal for me rather than
other users. It was also the point in development when I decided I wouldn't be
adding more features to the backend until initial version of the frontend is
done.


## Next Steps

The next big step is to design and implement analogous version `v0.0.1` for the
frontend. I've already implemented the proof of concept, but that's it for now.
Once the fronted is rolled out, I think ppacer would be ready as the MVP
version. I plan to present it to broader public then and start planning a
roadmap towards actual version `v1.0.0`.
