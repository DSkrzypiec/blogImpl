## Intro

At the beginning I want to say, thank you, to
[Tymek](https://github.com/tmakowski) for introducing me into SFF and general
building a PC area. He also gave me a lot of tips and advices which surely
saved me many hours of reading hardware specs.

For last ten years I've been using laptops as my main interface for programming
and browsing Internet. The most important reason for that was me being a student
for whom battery life and device's weight was the most crucial properties.

When Tymek told me about small form factor (SFF) PCs I though it's a great
idea and it's time to build my own PC.
