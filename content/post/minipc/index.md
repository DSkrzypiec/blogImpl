## Intro

At the beginning I want to say, thank you, to
[Tymek](https://github.com/tmakowski) for introducing me into SFF and general
building a PC area. He also gave me a lot of tips and advices which surely
saved me many hours of reading hardware specs.

For last ten years I've been using laptops as my main interface for programming
and browsing Internet. Reason for that was me being a student
for whom battery life and device's weight was more important then better specs.
I needed something mobile. Nowadays I rarely have to use PC outside and when I
do Termux on my phone is usually enough.

Small Form Factor (SFF) PCs are PCs which fits in case of volume smaller then
20 liters. Just a regular PC but put in rather small case. When Tymek told me
about SFF PCs I though it's a great idea and it's time to build my own PC. I've
never even build regular size PC ever before.


## Planning

As it turned out the most difficult part of building small PC is getting a
small case. Usually small cases are produced in batches - there is no serial
production. Therefore number of cases and availability are limited.
At first I've selected Cooler Master NR200 case but later on changed my mind to
Dan A4 sfx. Small 7.2 liter volume case.
