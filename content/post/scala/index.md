## Intro

This post is about my first thoughts on Scala programming language. There is a
great chance that I'll be using Scala in the upcoming months, so I've read
[Programming in Scala](https://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala_5ed)
in the last couple of days. Besides reading a book I also watched a bunch
presentations and tutorials on YouTube and write few simple programs as
an exercise.

Scala is the most similar to F# from all programming languages I know.
Therefore there will be few comparisons to F# and few general thoughts.
