## Intro

I'll start by stating that I don't like fuzziness. It's the main reason I
didn't stick to machine learning and data science at the beginning of my
career. Instead I've transitioned to programming and data engineering.

And here I am writing about _fuzzy_ finder in Vim. That's because of
[fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) Vim package. It has some very
convenient feature that I have been looking for. More on this later in the
post. I still believe you should know (at least try to know) file tree
structure of a project your working on. Fuzzy finders might pull you away from
this practice very quickly. And I do think it's a bad idea.

However let's assume you have a firm grasp of your project's structure tree but
it's large project with very deep tree. In this case, when you know what you
are looking for, it might saves you time for typing long file paths.

Before I jump to _fzf.vim_ package let's discuss [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
first.
