## Intro

Last Saturday, 17Th October 2020, Całka (one of my two cats) had to be put to sleep.
Name Całka translates from Polish to English as [Integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral).
Me and my (at that time) girlfriend were maths undergrads when we've taken
Całka from animal shelter in early 2016. That probably explains the name.

For last two months Całka fought with really nasty jaw bone cancer. It was
growing fast. It was too big to even consider surgery. She was given
painkillers regularly and some other drugs but nothing more can be done in
this case. She was very strong. She fought twice as she was expected to by the vet.
At point when she start to eat less we've made the decision.


## Adoption

In late 2015 our first cat Leon have been in depression. In early 2016, after trying few
collars with pheromones we've decided to adopt a kitten from animal shelter.
We went for tiny kitten but we've came back with six kilograms (thirteen
pounds) adult cat. She was the first cat which was introduced to us in the shelter. We
were sceptical but after she was gave to me and she started purring we've
change our minds.

When we come home Całka was almost twice as big as our first cat!
She was a bit lazy in comparison to Leon. Fortunately the main activity for
Leon was to fight and run with Całka. After about two weeks Całka started to
jump and run. At the beginning she was just laying on her back and try to fight
back using only her paws but without moving the body.
