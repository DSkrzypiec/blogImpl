## Intro

This post is dedicated to [AWK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK). Despite the
title AWK is not totally forgotten but still many data scientists and engineers
have never heard of it. Since 1977 many things have changed in the data world,
especially the scale, but in my opinion it's still relevant and useful tool in
2022.


## What is AWK

AWK is a tiny, domain-specific language for text processing. It can be used via
`awk` program which is usually available on UNIX-like systems out of the box. From
this point on I'll use AWK as the reference to the language and the program.

AWK was designed and developed by three office mates in Bell Labs in 1970s -
Alfred **A**ho, Peter **W**einberger and Brian **K**ernighan. It was released
in 1977! 45 years ago! How many IT tools from over 40 years ago do you use?
I guess not many. Why would anyone should use tool that old? Isn't there any
better nowadays? Basically no. I think mentioned authors solved very generic
problem using simple and beautiful design. There is very little to improve in
term of design and high level aspects.

For someone who has never used AWK it's probably still not clear what AWK
does, so let's focus on this point.
