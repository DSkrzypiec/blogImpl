I've been using Vim for about 3 years now and I feel very comfortable using it.
But recently I've got feeling that for a long time I didn't make any progress
regarding my movement in Vim. In those years 
`w\W`, `b\B`, `e\E`, `t`, `f`, `/`, `?`, `$`, `^`, `0`,
`}` and `G` were my best friends for making fast and precise moves in normal mode.
Don't get me wrong. With those I'm happy and still can finish editing much more
quicker than in standard text editor. 
Recently I've noticed I'm making many movements like `jjj`, `kkkk`, `www`,
`bjww` and so on. I do use counters like `4w`, `5j` but apparently not enough.


Therefore I gave myself a **challenge**:
{{% blockquote %}}
**[vim at work]** If I'd use three (or more) identical key strokes in the row 
than I have to skip next coffee.

**[vim at home]** If I'd use three (or more) identical key strokes in the row 
than I have to stay at gym 10 minutes longer.
{{% /blockquote %}}

I'm making this challenge public for extra motivation.
This challenge starts today and will end in mid-November. After that period I'll
make another post with results of this challenge. I hope I'll learn something
new about Vim or at least I'll introduce more efficient habits in my movement in
Vim. I really don't want to quit drinking coffee...
