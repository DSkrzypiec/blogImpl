## Finished application for a factoring company

In April 2020 I've finished working on the project for a factoring company. The
main goal of the project was to build an application for calculating some
specific formulas and models for risk management. This project was special for
me because it was __mine__ project. I was the manager, developer, PMO and
tester. I've designed the database. I've gone through all historical data and
I've studied legacy models and calculations. I've sketched core of the
application and I've implemented most of the functionalities. Rest of
functionalities was implemented by two interns and one junior dev under my
supervision. I was also the one responsible for the communication with the
client.

As one can expect it was a bit too much. I've spent many nights and few
weekends to meet the hard deadline but I've done it. After that I said "never
again" and I've changed teams at work. I learned a lot but the price was too high.
Especially with the one-year-old at home.

## Summary of 2020

It was for sure the one year which was the most different from previous ones.
Mostly due to the whole global COVID-19 pandemic and its implications.
