## Intro

Last month after my daughter was born we've received a bunch
of documents in this matter. Birth certificate, medical papers
assignment of [PESEL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PESEL),
etc. When I was about to put those papers into document folders
I thought it's time for digitalization.

Most of our very important documents like mortgage papers or university
diplomas exist only in physical version without any copy either digital or
physical. We had in plans to scan or at least make a photo of those but we
didn't do it. Therefore I thought let's make this right.

Besides documents, in so-called *HomeApp* I would also want to keep track of
usage of water and energy in our home, bank transactions history and list
of our books.
