## Intro

In August 2021 [I left PwC](https://dskrzypiec.dev/leaving-pwc) and joined
Allegro Pay in role of senior data engineer. Allegro Pay is a fintech sub
company of biggest e-commerce in central Europe -
[Allegro](https://allegro.pl). I've worked there for a year and in this post I
want to summarized my experiences. 


## Onboarding and first thoughts

Onboarding process in Allegro took four (4) days! That was very smooth
introduction without any hassle. There was presentations about company culture,
history and so on. It was rather pleasant experience.

In contrast to PwC, Allegro is a tech company from the beginning. One of example
of the difference is that Allegro have crucial internal IT systems centralized.
Like identity and access management. In PwC it was more dependent on a team and
region. In Allegro it's centralized. If I needed some access I immediately know
where should I make a request. The same remains true for all HR systems.

In PwC we mainly have used email as communication medium. Internal communicator
was used only for quick chats. History older than a day was deleted from
communicator, so all important information was exchanged via email. In Allegro
people use Slack. There are support and help channels for everything. It's very
easy to browse through channels and find information or just ask. In PwC often
I wouldn't know who should I ask, so usually things were flowing through my
direct manager.
