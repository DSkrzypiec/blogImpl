## Intro

After **six and a half** (6.5) years I'm leaving PwC. In this post I wanted to
shortly described my history in PwC and perhaps expose what is like to work in
consulting.


## Joining PwC

I've been interviewed to PwC in December 2014 for position somewhere between
intern and first year consultant. At that time I was studying on the first year
of my masters degree. I've started since February 2015 because I've had exams
in January at the uni.

Initially I was recruited to a new team in PwC - Data Analytics which suppose
to be first tech team with programmers and analysts. At that time the team had
about 8 people.

After few weeks I joined my first big project. In general we had to built
credit risk models complaint with new regulation -
[IFRS 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFRS_9) for one of biggest Polish banks.
This project was done with cooperation with Financial Risk Management (FRM)
team. The project was very long in PwC terms - over 3 years. Somewhere in
between my team has changed and I become member of FRM team. The wording is
intentional. I wasn't aware of this change for quite some time.


## Fresh consultant

One of the biggest advantage of working in consulting is that you can work with
many different domains, problems and technologies without changing your job. I
have a funny example for this. Around July or August 2015 I was asked by my
manager "Hey Damian, do you want to fly to London for a week to make some
dashboards in Tableau? The flight is on Monday.". The question was asked on
Thursday, prior to that Monday. I answered "Sure but I don't know Tableau". He
answered "Tableau is easy and you got Friday and whole weekend!". So I've
flown together with an intern and another consultant. Without any manager or
any experienced colleague. It was unexpected for me. The whole situation was
unreal for me. We've got a credit card and few days later we had to work for the
client in London using completely new tools and be confident and professional.
Fortunately Tableau was rather easy and we fairly knew SQL so we managed to do
the job.

But usually I worked from office in Warsaw on local projects or foreign
projects also from local office.
