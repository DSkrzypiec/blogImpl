## Intro

After **six and a half** (6.5) years I'm leaving PwC. In this post I wanted to
shortly described my history in PwC and perhaps expose what is like to work in
consulting.


## Joining PwC

I've been interviewed to PwC in December 2014 for position somewhere between
intern and first year consultant. At that time I was studying on the first year
of my masters degree. I've started since February 2015 because I've had exams
in January at the uni.

Initially I was recruited to a new team in PwC - Data Analytics which suppose
to be first tech team with programmers and analysts. At that time the team had
about 8 people.

After few weeks I joined my first big project. In general we had to built
credit risk models complaint with new regulation -
[IFRS 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFRS_9) for one of biggest Polish banks.
This project was done with cooperation with Financial Risk Management (FRM)
team. The project was very long in PwC terms - over 3 years. Somewhere in
between my team has changed and I become member of FRM team. The wording is
intentional. I wasn't aware of this change for quite some time.


## Fresh consultant

One of the biggest advantage of working in consulting is that you can work with
many different domains, people, problems and technologies without changing your
job. I have a funny example for this. Around July or August 2015 I was asked by
my manager "Hey Damian, do you want to fly to London for a week to make some
dashboards in Tableau? The flight is on Monday.". The question was asked on
Thursday, prior to that Monday. I answered "Sure but I don't know Tableau". He
answered "Tableau is easy and you got Friday and whole weekend!". So I've
flown, together with an intern and another consultant. Without any manager or
any experienced colleague. It was unexpected for me. The whole situation was
unreal. We've got a credit card and few days later we had to work for
the client in London using completely new tools and be confident and
professional. Fortunately Tableau was rather easy and we fairly knew SQL so we
managed to do the job. This might be extreme example but in general there are
many different projects for many different clients in variety of fields.

Usually I work from office in Warsaw on local projects or foreign
projects also from local office. During my first two years in PwC, as
consultant, I mostly did data analysis with T-SQL, R and Excel. Including data
validation, data preparation and everything around data that will lead to
building models and simulations. In technical perspective that was around 60%
T-SQL, 20% Excel and 20% R.
Because of many reasons very large part of writing calculations and simulations
for building a model was done in T-SQL. Looking back I know that T-SQL
definitely wasn't the right tool for this. Positive side was that we pushed SQL
queries to its limits. Also we had to design data schema right.  Otherwise it's
really hard to test correctness.  Nevertheless it was a good practice to me to
write such complex algorithms in SQL, not even a programming language!

There was one quick project somewhere in 2016 which had a big impact on me. It
was some simulation optimization to reduce execution time from 6-8 hours to
hopefully minutes. I was asked to rewrite part of solution (2-3 algorithms)
from T-SQL to C#. The methodology was fairly familiar to me but I didn't
produce any commercial code in C# before. The main idea was to rewrite T-SQL to
C# and add it as C# assembly to SQL Server in form of stored procedures.
Therefore interface for the client was the same but implementation was done in
another technology. I've learned a lot on this 3-week project. I started by
implementing data loading from the database and write many, many unit tests (we
had to produce identical results as T-SQL version). I very much enjoyed coding
in C# even though it was a new thing for me. The deadline was close and as it
turned out the other dev didn't make much of a progress. I finished my part 3
days before the deadline. At this point leading dev asked me to take over the
other part of the implementation. We worked 9 hours on Saturday and from 11am
on Sunday to 7am on Monday without any break. We finished implementation about
6am on Monday and thanks to unit tests we were pretty sure it was correct
around 7am. Around 8am I went to sleep and leading dev had to go the bank to
present and to deliver our solution. Rewritten implementation with parallel
simulation in C# in the end took only few minutes to produce the result. After
this project I though that this the thing I want to do. Implementation in
statically typed and compiled language was luxury for me a that time.


## Rough times

Date 1st January of 2018 was the date. It was the deadline of introducing IFRS 9
regulations in European banks. The fall 2017 was very stressful. We were
working on finalizing credit risk models for IFRS 9 and also working together
with another team on the production implementation of our models to be part of
the IT application for the client.

Generally in PwC people works around 9-10 hours a day which is much more than
in regular job. But at that time, I remember, we would start a day on 8-9am and
work together (physically in one room) till 1-3am in the night. This period
took about two weeks. After that we've presented our models to the client and
everything was great. Around December 2017 our models was done and discussed
with the client and theoretically our job was done. But practically
the implementation (in the IT tool) of our model wasn't even close to be done.
So we helped with testing and even proposing the C# implementation of fixes.
This also was a bit stressful because of very hard deadline and communication
problems between teams.

I think that was the roughest time in my 6.5 years in PwC.


## Consulting phenomena

I wanted to pause for a moment and write about very interesting phenomena.
Why people in PwC work that much?

That's very interesting question with no simple answer. I think it's very
interesting phenomena. Most of people who I worked with in PwC are very smart
so how come they work long hours without any significant compensation?
I think PwC gather people who are interested in solving problems. And there are
many very interesting, in many ways, problems to handle. Add to it
responsibility with impossible deadline and it creates a real challenge.
Most of reasonable people doesn't want to fail. So they are put enormous effort
to do the job and prove that they can do it.

By doing this you got another task with even more fetched requirements of
deadline because you shift definition for new "normal". Once again you don't
want to fail so you keep working. At the evenings, weekends and so on.

In practice no one is forced to work. You are just put in position where you
have to deliver impossible task and you don't want to fail and don't want to
complain about the task itself.

It's no unusual the fact that project for hundreds of thousands of dollars are
done with 2-3 consultants or senior consultant and manager.

Another point is that there are usually no __interesting__ alternative to this
job. For example the main alternative for colleagues from FRM is to transfer to
risk team in a bank. But that is perceived as very stable and boring job.

Data Analytics (DA) was another thing. Its sub team Data Tools which is
contained mostly with programmers have very different dynamic. All programmers
work 8 hours a day and nothing more. Probably because they can easily change
job to another interesting one. That was fascinating to me to experience this.
To work in PwC and have steady and no long work hours. But this topic I'll
describe later.


## Focus on technology

After around 3.5 years (2018 H2) of regular consulting projects in credit risk
I started talking to my managers and directors that I'm more interested in
technology rather than credit risk and modelling. Fortunately they backed me up
and let me to spend around 70% of my time on internal projects focused on
**implementation** of tools for credit risk both internal and for clients.

This was something new in FRM. It was interesting for me to work on mostly
implementation. Without client meetings, Excels and long hours in the office.
I also conduct few technical trainings for our team and provide internal
technical consultation for other projects in our team.

Besides implementing internal R package for building scoring models we also
implemented few MVPs and prototypes of applications within about a year.
Occasionally I was pulled out my tech bubble to real consulting projects when
there was a need but most of my time I spent on implementations.

In fall 2019 the time has come for _my project_.


## My project

The project was about to rewrite a tool for IFRS 9 written in Excel and Power
Query to another technology for a factoring company. It was a big deal for me
because of two reasons. Firstly this was the first project in FRM where we had
to deliver actual application. Secondly I was designer, leading dev, tester,
manager and project manager on this project.

We had to choose SQLite and R with frontend in
[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com), because of reasons. We had around
3-4 months for the project. On my team I had two interns and one consultant.

There was one hidden matter that wasn't in the agreement but what must be done
in order to rewrite application - create historical database based on the old
result files. The initial tool used Excel as UI, calculation engine and the
database.
