## Intro
I want to share with you a list of my favorite tech talks. I can honestly say
this is my hobby. Watching tech talks on YouTube. Here I've prepared list of
eleven my most liked presentations. For each of them I try to describe why those
are special to me and why their are worth watching. Order of titles is not
particularly important. 

I wanted to keep this list pretty short (around 10) therefore it's not complete.
I've selected only fraction of those I really like. Nevertheless please let me
know if you've watched tech talk which had great impact on you. I've probably 
seen it but if not (hopefully) I would enjoy something new.
