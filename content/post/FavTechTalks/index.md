## Intro
I want to share with you a list of my favorite tech talks. I can honestly say
this is my hobby. Watching tech talks on YouTube. Here I've prepared list of
eleven my most liked presentations. For each of them I try to describe why those
are special to me and why their are worth watching. Order of titles is not
particularly important. 

I wanted to keep this list pretty short (around 10) therefore it's not complete.
I've selected only fraction of those I really like. 

## "Data-Oriented Design and C++" - Mike Acton [CppCon 2014]
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc

I put this talk first because it's special for me. This talk points many 
programming approaches and attitudes that are close to my heart. Obviously it's
about data-oriented design but Mike points several general "truths" 



## "From Vim muggle to wizard in ten easy steps" - Erik Falor [Openwest 2015]
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MquaityA1SM

It's my favorite talk in **vim overview** category. I'd recommended this
presentation to anyone who wants to check out what is vim, what it does and why it's
cool. Erik has prepared very good presentation. Besides presenting ten selected
features of vim he also mentioned about history of text editors and vim. This
talk is in form of live coding but very well prepared. There is no typos, delays
and so on. The pace of presentation is rather fast but for an overview I think
it's excellent. I really enjoyed listening to this talk. I think after this talk
I've deep dived into vim.


## "Advanced Python (or understanding Python)" - Thomas Wouters [Google 2007]
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_kZDvwofHY

This talk is from 2007. I've watched it around 2015, when I've already "know" Python
and I was shocked. Despite being few years old this talk contains very
detailed information about python fundamentals and its design. Till this talk
I've never seen something similar regarding Python. In case when you're already
experienced programmer and you're familiar with several programming languages
and you want to know what is Python this is IMO best talk you can get.
For beginners it might be too fast paced and a bit too advanced. I'd still
recommend it to anyone but not everyone will be able to learn Python from this
talk.


## "Go: building on the shoulders of giants and stepping on a few toes" - Steve Francia [2018]
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX8r6zATHGU

This talks is probably my favorite **Go overview** kind of talk. I very
appreciate history background and many well selected quotes. Presentation is
well structured and examples are very carefully prepared. I've rewatched this
talk many times. If you want to know why Go has been created and learn its most
common characterization this talk is a very good source. 


## "Why C++ Sails When the Vasa Sank" - Scott Meyers [2014]
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltCgzYcpFUI

// TODO

## "Go Concurrency Patterns" - Rob Pike [Google I/O 2012]
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6kdp27TYZs

I've seen few Rob's talks and each one of them was well prepared and very well
presented. This one I've seen in my early days of learning go and it gave
me a glimpse of what concurrent programming looks like in go. It gave me extra
motivation. I've done some examples and read 
[_CSP_](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3921).
Examples in this talk are very well selected - rather easy but precisely 
presenting ideas of main concepts regarding concurrency in go.
If you want to see why concurrency is fun in go in about 30 minutes it's the
best source IMO.


## "Growing a Language" - Guy L. Steel Jr. [1998]
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0

This talk is very special because of its form. I cannot say more without
spoilers but IMO the idea for this talk is great! Presentation is now over
twenty years old but characteristics Guy L. Steel gave on developing programming
language are mostly still accurate.


## "Efficiency with Algorithms, Performance with Data Structures" - Chandler Carruth [CppCon 2014]
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHNmRkzxHWs


## "Rich Code for Tiny Computers: A Simple Commodore 64 Game in C++17" - Jason Turner [CppCon 2016]
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBkNBP00wJE

Very interesting talk! As title suggests in this talk Jason Turner presents how
to implement "Pong" in C++17 and port it onto Commodore 64. Presentation is in
form of live coding (most parts was prepared beforehand). It was a pleasure to
watch how "zero overhead" in C++ looks like in action. This talk is both fun to
watch and also very inspiring learning modern C++. 


## "Linus Torvalds on git" - Linus Torvalds [Google 2007]
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8

[Git](https://www.git-scm.com/) nowadays is used every in software development.
This talk is presented by primary Git creator and designer - Linus Torvalds.
Linus describe Git and its features, compares it to another version control
management tools. During this talk you can find many interesting facts about Git
which you might not heard before. I think now it's one of the classic tech
talks. I'd recommend this talk also for Git users and for ones who want to start
learning Git.
