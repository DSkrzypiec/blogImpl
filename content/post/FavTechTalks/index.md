## Intro
I want to share with you a list of my favorite tech talks. I can honestly say
this is my hobby. Watching tech talks on YouTube. Here I've prepared list of
eleven my most liked presentations. For each of them I try to describe why those
are special to me and why their are worth watching. Order of titles is not
particularly important. 

I wanted to keep this list pretty short (around 10) therefore it's not complete.
I've selected only fraction of those I really like. Nevertheless please let me
know if you've watched tech talk which had great impact on you. I've probably 
seen it but if not (hopefully) I would enjoy something new.


## "Data-Oriented Design and C++" - Mike Acton [CppCon 2014]

I like this talk because I have very similar 

## "From Vim muggle to wizard in ten easy steps" - Erik Falor [Openwest 2015]
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MquaityA1SM

It's my favorite talk in **vim overview** category. I'd recommended this
presentation to anyone who wants to check out what is vim, what it does and why it's
cool. Erik has prepared very good presentation. Besides presenting ten selected
features of vim he also mentioned about history of text editors and vim. This
talk is in form of live coding but very well prepared. There is no typos, delays
and so on. The pace of presentation is rather fast but for an overview I think
it's excellent. I really enjoyed listening to this talk. I think after this talk
I've deep dived into vim.


## "Advanced Python (or understanding Python)" - Thomas Wouters [Google 2007]
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_kZDvwofHY

## "Go: building on the shoulders of giants and stepping on a few toes" - Steve Francia [2018]
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX8r6zATHGU

## "Why C++ Sails When the Vasa Sank" - Scott Meyers [2014]
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltCgzYcpFUI

## "Go Concurrency Patterns" - Rob Pike [Google I/O 2012]
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6kdp27TYZs

I've seen few Rob's talks and each one of them was well prepared and very well
presented. This one I've seen in my early days of learning go and it gave
me a glimpse of what concurrent programming looks like in go. It gave me extra
motivation. I've done some examples and read 
[_CSP_](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3921).
Examples in this talk are very well selected - rather easy but precisely 
presenting ideas of main concepts regarding concurrency in go.
If you want to see why concurrency is fun in go in about 30 minutes it's the
best source IMO.


## "Growing a Language" - Guy L. Steel Jr. [1998]
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0

This talk is very special becuase of its form. I cannot say more without
spoilers but IMO the idea for this talk is great! Presentation is now over
twenty years old but characteristics Guy L. Steel gave on developing programming
language are mostly still accurate.

## "Efficiency with Algorithms, Performance with Data Structures" - Chandler Carruth [CppCon 2014]
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHNmRkzxHWs

## "Rich Code for Tiny Computers: A Simple Commodore 64 Game in C++17" - Jason Turner [CppCon 2016]
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBkNBP00wJE

## "Cpu Caches and Why You Care" - Scott Meyers [code::dive conference 2014]
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDIkqP4JbkE

## "Linus Torvalds on git" - Linus Torvalds [Google 2007]
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8

Here will be summary :)
