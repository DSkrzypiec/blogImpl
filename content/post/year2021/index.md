## I've started jogging

On January 16th after a long pandemic home isolation I've started jogging. For
my whole life I always hate jogging. I love most sports but running was
something else. After almost a year in pandemic with gyms being closed and
almost no going outside I though that I'll give it a try.

At first two tries I couldn't run 500 meters without a break for catching a
breath. Unexpectedly body adaptation was very quick! After two weeks I could
run over 1500m without any break. That was very motivating.

I've kept running through the whole year. I started to like jogging after the
first two or three weeks of doing it, just when my endurance increased to the
level when jogging wasn't dying for me.


## My first MacBook Air (M1)

I've never been much of an Apple fan. At the end of 2020 Apple released the
first Mac Book with their own processor - M1. Reviews were amazing. I was very
interested. In March 2021 I decided to buy MacBook Air M1. Up to this point
I'm very happy with this choice. Performance is great, battery life is amazing
(still around 15-20h) and general build quality is beyond my expectations.
