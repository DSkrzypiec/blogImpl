## Intro

Almost five years passed since last time I've extensively used data frame
library to calculate things. I sort of switched from analyzing data and
building application around that to more "regular" programming
and data engineering. I sometimes use `data.table` in R or `pandas` in Python
for ad-hoc analysis but nowadays I rare need to do it.

Recently I was exposed to [polars](https://www.pola.rs). As they describe
*Lightning-fast DataFrame library for Rust and Python*. Initially I was
neutral, thinking "ok just another data frame library just written in rust",
but it turned out to be better in several aspects than other libraries of this
kind. I got excited about data frame library again, I didn't expect this to
happen.

In this post I'm gonna describe why I thinks it's better alternative to pandas,
`dplyr` or `data.table` and why I'm excited.
