## Intro

Recently I've visited [very interesting website](https://subtls.pages.dev) which presents byte by byte what happens
when website (data) is sent using TLS. One thing is to know roughly how TLS works and another one is to actually see
with explanations what is really happening. Under its influence I thought that I've been working with parquet files for
some time but I don't really their structure. I know its properties, how and when one should use it but I
have never really experienced what parquet format really is.

In this blog post I'll present my findings on the way to understand and **see** parquet files structure.
