## Intro

Foundations are important whatever you do. That was said by many. So why I'm
writing about that? It's because I'm worried about foundations situation in IT
world.

Foundations are by definition important, because all things built in given
space dependents on it. I'll try to describe why that matters in examples of
fields that I'm interested in.

I'll say it at least twice - there is no shame to back to basics even on senior
level of experience. Most of your practice should be focused on the
foundations.


## Maths

As my topology tutor, [Stefan
Jackowski](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Jackowski), said _mathematics
is brutally hierarchical and there is no way around this_ which is another
phrase for Euclid quote _there is no royal road to geometry_.

Foundations in maths are inevitable. It's very hard to do mathematics without
firm grasp of basics. It is even visible in middle school. If a pupil skip one
or two topics there is a great chance that he or she will have troubles with
next topics. That stays true on academic level too. In my opinion this is the
reason why most people finds mathematics relatively hard.

In Maths things are literally built on top of the axioms. There is nothing
outside axioms and its consequences. Therefore foundations are written into it.
There is very low probability that one can perform proofs and even read
maths without confident knowledge of the foundations.


## Calisthenics

Another field I'm interested in is calisthenics. Anyone who starts calisthenics
and sees classics like
[planche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planche_(exercise)) obviously want to
be able to do it. One might try to practice this exercise right away but
without establish strong foundations it's nearly impossible.

In this case is not as rigid as in case of maths. One physically can try
practice hard exercise. It will be just inefficient but not impossible.

In order to practice efficiently one must keep the foundations strong. They
(push ups, pull ups, dips and squats) might sound very boring in comparison to
planche or front lever but it is crucial to keep it strong with the perfect form.


## IT

The main field I'm into is IT. As we've already established foundations are
important whatever you do. Nowadays it is very easy to do many things in
programming without knowing almost any basics. For example you can train deep
neural network in Python with less than 100 lines of code without knowing any
maths and even Python, just depending on tutorials and tweaking upon examples.
It is not a bad thing on its own. Things shouldn't be overly complicated just
to force you to deepen your knowledge. Appropriate interface should be design.

What, in my opinion, can be a problem is that you can advance your career
really far without solid understanding of foundations. That even might gave you
an illusion that you know them. If you often say "yea, that is **probably**
done this way under the hood..." that might be a symptom. What is even worse is
thinking that you're too advanced in programming to even think about details of
basic concepts. One of symptoms of this one might be something like "let's not
talk about it, this should be **probably** optimized by compiler".

In case of programming foundations are very broad. Just to name a several areas
of IT foundations

* logic
* data structures and algorithms
* hardware (CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, ...)
* databases
* operating systems
* networking
* security
* programming languages
* compilers
* text editors and tools
* design (systems and UX)
* localizations (encodings, time zones and other local conventions)

Yep, that's not all but it is already a lot for _just_ a foundations. Good
universities covers most of those foundations across lectures and tutorials.
Even though you had those basics worked out back in a university you probably
forgot most of it after few years in the industry. We are truly standing on the
shoulders of giants and we rarely have to tweak around foundations in regular
job. I encourage you to not be ashamed of going back to basics and to broaden
your foundations. This will got you more then learning new js framework.
If your foundations are strong picking up anything on higher levels of
abstraction will be easy. You will not struggle.

In my opinion if you want advance in IT you should practice and most part of
this practice should be foundations. If you are a programmer you probably have
used HTTP server clients but have you ever written one? Do you know HTTP(S)
protocol? How TCP/IP is used in implementation of HTTP? How routing of
endpoints is done? How HTTP messages looks like in a memory? What is structure
of URL and what is URI? Why are there cookies? How clients establish connection
with another servers?  And many more...

My criteria for the question "do I really know how it's done?" is the answer
for the question "Am I able to program it in C?".

If you don't know where to start I'd recommend to start reading standard
library of your favorite programming language. I'd also recommend [Go's
standard library](https://pkg.go.dev/std) even for people how don't program in
Go. It is very well written and documented and Go is pretty straightforward
language.


## Summary

I've seen on my example how focusing on the foundations in each field made a
progress much faster. Do not be ashamed of going back to basics. Foundations
cannot be too strong. Patiently developed levels upon foundations will bring
satisfaction and fulfilment. Build gradually. Work, consistency and patience
will be rewarded.

As maths grad who stepped into data analysis and programming I initially
started from very high level programming languages (R and Python). But in order
to deepen my understanding (and performance) I was going down the abstraction
levels to improve my foundations. It took me few years and I have still plenty
to learn but I think I know what is important and what I should be focused on.

Obviously I'm not saying that you should practice only foundations. You should
checkout new languages, tools and frameworks but that shouldn't be vast
majority of time spent.
