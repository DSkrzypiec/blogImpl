## Continuation of 2022


In 2023, I maintained my running routine, pursued table tennis training, and practiced fundamental calisthenics,
including pull-ups, push-ups, and dips. However, I decided to discontinue my Russian language studies, mostly due to
lack of time.


## I've left TCL and joined Point72

## Running

This year I continued my practice of running. At this point I enjoy running quite a lot. I try to go for a run at
least 3 times a week. I try to do two runs on weekdays within distance range 7.5-11.5km (4.6-7.2 miles) and one
longer run on weekends. In March I've run my first half marathon in over two and a half hours (2:34). In September I've
run my second half marathon. This time I've done it in two hours and eleven minutes.

I'm very happy with the progress! I'm planning to run another one in March 2024 and the goal is to break two hours.
This year I've also run another [Runmageddon](https://www.runmageddon.pl). This time I choose _classic_ version which
is around 12km distance and over 50 obstacles to overcome. That was a goal from 2022. I'm glad I did it.


My running trainings summary over the last two years:

I'm very happy to see, that my average run duration increased to almost 50 minutes and pace declined to around 6
minutes per kilometer. My current pace average is around 5'37" per kilometer on 10km runs, so I hope to get much better
results in 2024.


## Started working on implementing New Scheduler

In August 2023 I started working on my version of a scheduler. I wrote a post on this in here - [New
Scheduler](https://dskrzypiec.dev/new-scheduler/). Goal for 2024 is implementing most of fundamental functionalities,
including the UI.

In general progress is pretty slow, since I'm spending around 8-10 hours per week on this project, but it is nice to
have solid long term project. I enjoy working on it.


## HomeApp v2

Over a year ago I've [rewritten Home App in Go](https://dskrzypiec.dev/home-app-go/) and moved it onto AWS. That was
great decision! We (me and my wife) use HomeApp on regular basis. Corresponding Home Database grew to 1 GB in size,
over 300 digitalized documents, over 40 e-books and around 8500 bank transactions. Having HomeApp open publicly (not
behind private VPN) made it much more accessible.

In 2023 I've added two new features. One is mentioned uploading/downloading of e-books. The other one is Financial
explorer which basically aggregates all financial transactions which contains given phrase in a description on month
level. It looks like this:

It's rather simple but still very effective regarding looking into trends of our expenses.


## Learned about HTTPS, TLS and cryptography

Around October or November 2023 I've received significantly bigger, then usually bill from AWS. As it turned out my
first 12 months on AWS has passed and at the same time my discount on EC2 and elastic load balancing. I've been using
the second smallest EC2 instance, so that wasn't the main part of the bill. It was ELB. Why I used ELB in the first
place? I didn't have multiple EC2s to load balance traffic. I've set it up, because on AWS it's the easiest way to
setup HTTPS via trivial load balancer and target groups. In this setup I can use certificate from AWS. That was the
only reason.

In that moment I decided it's the time to learn about `S` in HTTPS. It wasn't because of money. I treated is as
reminder that this is the high time to pay technical debt of not learning those things before I publish HomeApp on AWS.

I could probably take another shortcut and use ChatGPT, to setup HTTPS for HomeApp without using AWS Load Balancer and
certificate from AWS. I didn't want to do it. I wanted to actually learn about those concepts. So I did. I learned
about certificates, chain of trust, how those are generated, signed and verified. Next I learned about asymmetric and
symmetric encryption. About [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) and
[Diffie-Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffieâ€“Hellman_key_exchange). I looked into mathematics behind those
algorithms and systems. It turned out that cryptography is very interesting and very elegant in many aspects. I really
enjoyed it. On high level I learned also about SSL and TLS protocols which combines most of the above concepts.

Eventually I've setup HTTPS for HomeApp using certificate generated by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) and
getting rid of AWS LB. I ended up with simpler infrastructure for HomeApp, lower AWS bill, and obtained very
interesting and useful knowledge on cryptography.


## Goals for 2024

* Run half marathon in under two hours.
* Try to run my first full marathon.
* Continue working on New Scheduler.
* Got better in writing frontends (Go + tmpl + HTMX?).
* Read a textbook on quantum mechanics.
