## Continuation of 2022 highlights

**TODO**

As the first highlight of year 2022 I wanted to mention the continuation of most
of habits that I've started in 2021. I'm still jog regularly. I tried to
learn Russian somehow regularly over the year. I had some breaks but generally I
learned a bit and didn't forget what I've learned in 2021. I still do pull ups
and chin ups on daily basis. I've run three (3km, 6km and 6km)
[Runmageddons](https://www.runmageddon.pl) in 2022! There are plans for going
for 12km in 2023. I'm also still amazed by quality of my Macbook Air M1, after
almost two years now. Battery still can make over 10 hours of work on single
charging. The last one is not a habit, but I wanted to mention it here.
