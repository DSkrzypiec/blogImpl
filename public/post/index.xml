      <description>Intro I want to share with you a list of my favorite tech talks. I can honestly say this is my hobby. Watching tech talks on YouTube. Here I&#39;ve prepared list of eleven my most liked presentations. For each of them I try to describe why those are special to me and why their are worth watching. Order of titles is not particularly important.
I wanted to keep this list pretty short (around 10) therefore it&#39;s not complete.</description>

      <description>Intro For few years when I was practicing data science I&#39;ve used quantiles a lot. I knew what it is and when one should use it. I knew mathematical definition and intuition around quantiles but if someone would ask me to implement it from scratch I wouldn&#39;t know how to do it right away.
So what is a quantile? It&#39;s a one of most commonly used descriptive statistic. It gives us aggregated information about sample&#39;s distribution.</description>
